The first thing that i did to the question number 4 is.
 I go to the github and update the README.md manually.
and then i pulled the changes to my local by typing - git pull "clone link"

The i created this empty file called "up_to_date"
and added some instruction and commands inside it by using "nano"

after that i pushed it to remote repo. hre is down below the steps/commands

- touch up_to_date
- nano up_to_date .../added some contents and saved it by presing Ctrl + O/
- git add .
- git commit -m "How to be up to date in git"
- git push
